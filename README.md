# Indian-Banknote-Recognition-using-Alexnet-SVM-DTC-RFC-and-KNN-algorithms

With the help of different machine learning methods, including SVM, Decision Tree Classifier (DTC), Random Forest Classifier (RFC), and K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), this research attempts to create a system for recognising Indian banknotes. According to their characteristics, the system will be able to recognise and categorise various types of Indian banknotes, which will help with effective cash management and verification.
